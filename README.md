# Springboard data science bootcamp

This repo is for learning projects that I completed as part of Springboard’s data science bootcamp. Below is a quick summary of the bootcamp and the important directories in this repo.

## Summary

Springboard’s data science bootcamp is a part-time, online program focused on the practical application of data science. The curriculum requires about 550 hours of work across 18 units.  The content covers data cleaning, data exploration, data visualization, statistical methods, machine learning, advanced machine learning, software engineering, and data science at scale.

## Directories

This repo includes directories for:

* A capstone project focused on regression techniques, 
* A capstone project focused on time-series forecasts, and
* A dozen or so “mini-projects" that exercise skills related to SQL, JSON, inferential statistics, bayesian statistics, linear regression, logistic regression, text classification, clustering, and other topics.
